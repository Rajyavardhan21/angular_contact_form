To send static contact form data via email in an Angular application, you can use a combination of Angular's built-in email functionality and a backend server to handle the email sending.

Here are the general steps you can follow:

Create a contact form in your Angular application that collects the necessary data from the user (e.g., name, email, message).

Create a service in your Angular application that sends the contact form data to a backend server. You can use the Angular HttpClient module to make an HTTP POST request to the server with the form data as the request payload.

Set up a backend server that handles the HTTP POST request from the Angular application and sends an email containing the contact form data. There are various server-side technologies you can use for this, such as Node.js, PHP, or Python.

Configure your backend server to use an email service (such as Gmail, SendGrid, or Mailgun) to send the email containing the contact form data. You'll need to provide the email service with your email credentials and configure the email message to include the form data.

Once the email is sent successfully, you can return a response from the server to the Angular application indicating the success or failure of the email sending.

Here's some sample code for the Angular service that sends the contact form data to the backend server:

import { HttpClient } from '@angular/common/http';
import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';

@Injectable({
  providedIn: 'root'
})
export class ContactFormService {

  private serverUrl = 'http://localhost:3000/contact-form';

  constructor(private http: HttpClient) { }

  sendContactForm(formData: any) {
    return this.http.post(this.serverUrl, formData);
  }
}


This service sends an HTTP POST request to the server at http://localhost:3000/contact-form with the formData object as the request payload. You can use this service in your Angular component that contains the contact form to send the form data to the backend server.

Note that this is just an example and you'll need to modify it to fit your specific use case and server-side technology.

Backedn starts from here

there are many cloud-based backend services that offer email sending capabilities, such as SendGrid, Mailgun, and Amazon SES.

You can use these services in combination with a server-side technology of your choice (such as Node.js, PHP, or Python) to handle the email sending from your Angular application.

Here's an example of how you might use SendGrid with Node.js to send an email containing contact form data:

Install the SendGrid package for Node.js:

npm install --save @sendgrid/mail

Set up a SendGrid API key:

const sgMail = require('@sendgrid/mail');
sgMail.setApiKey('your-sendgrid-api-key');

Create an Express.js route that handles the contact form data and sends an email using SendGrid:

const express = require('express');
const bodyParser = require('body-parser');
const app = express();

app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({ extended: false }));
app.use(bodyParser.json());

app.post('/send-email', (req, res) => {
  const { name, email, message } = req.body;

  const msg = {
    to: 'your-email-address',
    from: email,
    subject: 'New contact form submission',
    text: `Name: ${name}\nEmail: ${email}\nMessage: ${message}`,
  };

  sgMail.send(msg)
    .then(() => {
      res.status(200).json({ message: 'Email sent successfully' });
    })
    .catch(error => {
      console.error(error);
      res.status(500).json({ error: 'Error sending email' });
    });
});

app.listen(3000, () => console.log('Server running on port 3000'));


This code sets up an Express.js server with a route at /send-email that accepts contact form data in the request body. It then uses SendGrid to send an email with the form data to your specified email address.

Note that this is just an example and you'll need to modify it to fit your specific use case and server-side technology.
